# Utility Functions

This here is a set of simple utility functions that are very generic and highly reusable.

One thing to note about them is that these should be pure functions, ie they should accept 0 or more arguments, and if called with the same set of arguments they should produce the exact same output, no matter what else have happend in the application or broader system.
